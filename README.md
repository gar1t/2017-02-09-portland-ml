# TensorFlow Tour - Feb 2017

Goal: Help attendees use TensorFlow more effectively

## Recent topics

These are topics that have been presented on at the TF meetups around
the world.

- Deep Learning Using TensorFlow and TensorFlow-Slim
- Teaching Recurrent Neural Networks Using TensorFlow
- Introduction to Neural Networks in TensorFlow

## Thoughts

### Patterns

I'm good at pattern talks. I have some insight into patterns that
developers ought to use when writing TensorFlow scripts.

This could emerge as a style guide that's published - and used to draw
attention to standards.

Misc notes:

- Cover prepare conventions (downloading)
- Use of flags
- Don't use notebooks and why - if you're linear, if you're non-linear
- Patterns used by Keras and TFLearn!!

## Proposals

### Title: Software Patterns in TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a flexible, general purpose computational library that's
used to implement a wide range of machine learning models. Its
flexibility however presents a challenge: how do teams discover and
apply effective software patterns in their projects? In this
presentation, Garrett Smith, founder of Guild AI, will share his
experience working with dozens of TensorFlow projects and discuss
patterns that work well and those that don't when writing TensorFlow
code.

Garrett will cover:

- Project structure
- Variable naming conventions
- Canonical functions and workflow
- Parameterization using flags
- Logging and retraining experiment results
- Conventions for serving trained models
- Lessons from TFLearn and Keras

Don't miss this unique presentation that combines software engineering
disciplines with traditional machine learning workflow in TensorFlow!

### Title: Introduction to Deep Learning with TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a flexible, general purpose computational library that's
used to implement a wide range of machine learning models. TensorFlow
is perhaps best known for its support for deep neural networks. In
this talk, Garrett Smith, founder of Guild AI, will provide a brief
introduction to deep learning using coding examples from TensorFlow.

Garrett will cover:

- Basics of deep learning and neural networks
- Creating models with TensorFlow
- Training with TensorFlow
- Testing and evaluating model performance
- Running trained models in production

If you're new to deep learning or TensorFlow, this talk will give you
a high level understand of both topics and how you can apply them
practically. If you're already experienced with TensorFlow, Garrett
will cover many topics that aren't typically covered in introductory
material including developer workflow and TensorFlow production
issues.

## Bio

Garrett Smith is founder of Guild AI, an open source toolkit that
helps developers gain insight into their TensorFlow
experiments. Garrett has over twenty years of software development
experience and has managed teams across a wide range of product
development efforts. His has expertise in building reliable,
distributed back-end systems and in operations. Prior to founding
Guild AI, Garrett led CloudBees PaaS division, which hosted hundreds
of thousands of Java applications at scale. Garrett is a frequent
instructor and speaker at software conferences and an active member of
the Erlang community, maintaining several prominent open source
projects.
